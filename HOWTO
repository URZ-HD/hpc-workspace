very short introduction to workspace++ 

WHATS NEW

- incompatible file formats for DB and config
- unification of config, all config options moved into one config file,
  user exceptions are kept in a extra file which must not be readable for user commands
- rewrite of ws_release and ws_allocate in C++, setuid optional, capability can be used if 
  supported by filesysten.
  never was comfortable with the python in C hack, this is cleaner, less attack vectors.
- added/changed functionality
    - ws_release always moves the data away when called (new semantics! users affected!)
    - more admin options with ws_list, like seeing expired workspaces
    - more output control in ws_list
    - support for email reminders in ws_allocate/ws_cleaner
    - YAML key:value configration and database, easyer to extend
    - man pages
    - ws_allocate has an argument -u  so root can extend workspaces
      using    ws_allocate -u owner -x name duration
      duration can be longer than allowed for the user, and it does not consume an extension,
      so it works even if remaining extensions of the workspace is 0
      Users can do this is as well if they can access the workspace!
    - ws_allocate can prefix a workspace per user using a LUA callout.
        example: spaces: /lustre/ws
        with a callout could create
        workspace: /lustre/ws/academic/username-workspacename
        when the callout returns 'academic' for 'username'
        ATTENTION: no code to modify permissions and ownerships of the subdirectory,
        you better create them all as needed!
    - ws_restore can restore expired workspaces, can be called by user 

PLANNED

- striping support in ws_allocate (lustre parameters, probably we want to drop some 
  capabilities before we do that, needs study how to do that)
- quota settings

BUGS

- when LUA callout to prefix workspaces is used, the prefix directories do
    not get proper owner and permissions (what is propper anyhow???)


HOW TO INSTALL

write a config file, see ws.conf_full_sample, validate it 
with ws_validate_config myconfig.conf

copy it to /etc/ws.conf
may be having /etc/ws.conf being a link is a good idea,
so different versions can be kept.

compile the tools with
./getyamlcpp.sh
cmake .
make


on filesystem with capability support:
copy ws_allocate and ws_release and ws_restore and ws_list where wanted,
( and set capabilites with

setcap "CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE=p CAP_CHOWN=p" ws_allocate
setcap "CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE=p" ws_release
)

OR (on filesystems without capabilities and now default in build,
can be changed with ccmake .)
make ws_allocate ws_release ws_restore setuid root

install manpages.

try.
have fun.
complain.


REMARKS

- capabities need support from OS and filesystem
  nfs and lustre are known not to work
- for SuSE users: SLES11.SP3 needs file_caps=1 on kernel command line
- for Redhat6 users: system yaml seems to be to old,
  change in CMakeLists.txt
  FIND_LIBRARY(YAML libyaml-cpp.so)
  to
  FIND_LIBRARY(YAML no-libyaml-cpp.so)
- with boost 1.70, use yaml-cpp-0.6.2 or later
- for Redhat7 uses, enable USE_BOOST_REGEXP, std::regexp seems to be broken in standard gcc
